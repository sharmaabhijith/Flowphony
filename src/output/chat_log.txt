To tackle the "Balkan Brass Extravaganza" task, let's break down the client's request into key musical elements and then decompose it into subtasks for the team.

### Musical Elements:
1. **Title**: Balkan Brass Extravaganza
2. **Genre**: Inspired by Balkan brass bands
3. **Key/Chord Progression**: E7-Am7-D7-G7
4. **Instruments**: Trumpets, Tubas, Trombones
5. **Tempo**: Fast and energetic
6. **Time Signature**: Asymmetric (e.g., 7/8 or 11/8, commonly used in Balkan music)
7. **Character**: Lively motif, exuberant

### Decomposing into Subtasks:

1. **Melody Agent**:
   - Task: Create a lively melody that fits the chord progression (E7-Am7-D7-G7) and is suitable for the trumpet section, considering the asymmetric time signature.

2. **Harmony Agent**:
   - Task: Develop harmonies for the melody created by Melody Agent, suitable for trombones and potentially additional trumpets, ensuring the harmony is rich and fitting for a brass band.

3. **Instrumentation Agent**:
   - Task: Arrange the composition for the specified instruments (trumpets, tubas, and trombones), ensuring that the tubas provide a solid foundation, and the overall arrangement captures the energetic and lively spirit of Balkan brass music.

### Composition Process:

After assigning the tasks, the agents work on their respective parts. 

- **Melody Agent** creates a melody that is catchy and complex, fitting the asymmetric time signature (let's say 7/8) and the given chord progression. The melody is designed to be played primarily by the trumpets.
  
- **Harmony Agent** develops a harmony that complements the melody, adding depth to the composition. The harmony is tailored for the trombones, with consideration for additional trumpet parts to enhance the overall sound.

- **Instrumentation Agent** arranges the composition, ensuring that the tubas provide a driving rhythm section, underpinning the energetic tempo. The arrangement includes dynamic markings and articulations suitable for a lively Balkan brass performance.

### Sample ABC Notation:

Let's assume the agents have completed their tasks. Here's a simplified example of what the final ABC notation might look like. Note that actual notation might be more complex and detailed.
